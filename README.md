# Potato Disease Classification

This project focuses on potato disease classification using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The goal of the project is to develop a model that can accurately classify different diseases affecting potato plants based on input images. The model is built and trained using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images of healthy and diseased potato plants affected by various diseases. The dataset can be obtained from [source URL or name], and it is divided into training and testing sets. Each image is labeled with the corresponding disease class.

## Prerequisites

To run the code and reproduce the potato disease classification model, you need the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE of your choice

The following Python libraries are required as well:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

These libraries can be installed using pip with the following command:

```
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download and extract the ZIP file.

```
git clone https://github.com/SurajspatiL99/Potato-Disease-Classification.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```
cd potato-disease-classification
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python IDE.

```
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `potato-disease-classification.ipynb` file.

5. Execute the code cells in sequential order to build and train the potato disease classification model.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `potato-disease-classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

- `dataset/`: Directory that may contain the dataset images, or a placeholder for the dataset location or download instructions.

- `model/`: Directory that may contain the saved trained model or a placeholder for the model file.

## Model Architecture

The custom CNN model architecture used for potato disease classification may include multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The exact architecture and hyperparameters can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file.

## Evaluation and Performance Metrics

The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to classify potato diseases correctly.
